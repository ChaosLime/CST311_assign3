Run Server, then run at least 2 instances of client
<br>

See Comments in within programs for setup

To be ran on Python 3

UPDATE:
To test scenarios under client-aa.py and server-aa.py, run as follows:

server-aa.py
python server-aa.py 8001 <enter>
  
client-aa.py (instance 1)
python client-aa.py 8001 X Bob <enter>
  
client-aa.py (instance 2)
python client-aa.py 8001 Y Alice <enter>
  
There should be the message received and displayed on the server, and the server will send back results to each client, to be displayed by the clients


We can tweak the messages and client input as needed...
